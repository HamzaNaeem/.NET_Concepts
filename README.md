# .NET_Concepts API 🚀

A comprehensive **.NET learning and reference API** designed to showcase all the major concepts of modern .NET development.  
This project serves as both a **blueprint** for enterprise-grade applications and a **hands-on toolkit** for developers who want to master .NET.

---

## 📖 Overview
The **.NET Mastery API** demonstrates real-world implementations of core and advanced concepts in .NET, including:  

- Clean and scalable API architecture  
- Data access with Entity Framework Core  
- Authentication and Authorization (JWT, OAuth2, Identity)  
- Dependency Injection & Middleware customization  
- Async/await, exception handling, and logging  
- Caching, background services, and SignalR  
- Microservices readiness with gRPC and Docker  
- Unit/Integration testing and CI/CD integration  

This repository is **not just an API**—it's a **living guide** to mastering .NET.
